# zipcode-scraper
This was my first project for an Upwork.com client. It scrapes the database of unitedstateszipcodes.org for certain items of information on a list of around 50.000 zipcodes. It exports those results to a text file, which can then be exported to an excel book. The project includes multithreading in order to achieve the fastest speed possible.
